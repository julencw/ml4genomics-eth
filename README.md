# ML for Genomics — ETH Zürich (Autumn 2024)

LaTeX source and compiled PDF of my MSc-level course notes for **Machine Learning for Genomics** at **ETH Zürich** (Autumn 2024). 
Notes are organized **week-by-week** and aim to provide a concise overview of methods and key concepts.

## What’s inside
- `main.tex` — LaTeX source
- `main.pdf` — compiled notes
- Weekly structure (Week 1, Week 2, …) following the course timeline

## Contents
- Molecular biology refresher (DNA, genes, TFs, epigenetics)
- TF binding & motif models (PWM) → CNN/RNN/attention methods
- Chromatin accessibility & histone marks; HMM/LDA; sequence→signal models
- 3D genome & promoter–enhancer prediction (CNN/LSTM/Transformers)
- Variant effect & expression prediction; survival analysis basics
- Deconvolution (NMF/ICA), bulk vs scRNA-seq
- scRNA-seq imputation, batch correction, clustering & annotation
- Graph/OT methods and spatial data; autoencoders & VAEs

> Some paper/method deep dives are marked **TODO**; the notes still give a solid, end-to-end overview of the course.
